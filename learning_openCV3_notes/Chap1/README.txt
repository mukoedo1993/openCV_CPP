Computer vision is the transformation from a still or video camera into either a decision or a new representation.

Because we are such visual creatures, it is easy to be fooled into thinking computer vision tasks are easy.
In a machine vision system, however, a computer receives a grid of numbers from the camera or from disk, and that's it.

But...
Given a two-dimensional view of a 3D world, there is no unique way to reconstruct the 3D signal. Formally, such an ill-posed problem has no
unique or definitive solution.

Contextual information <-- to work around the limitations imposed on us by visual sensors

Contextual information can also be modeled explicitly with machine learning techniques. Hidden variables such as size, orientation to gravity, and so on
can be correlated with their values in a labelled training set.

The next problem facing computer vision is: noise
(i): statistics <- to detect the edge of an image

As a general rule, the more constrained a computer vision context is, the more we can rely on those constraints to simplify the problem and the more reliable 
our final solution will be.

OpenCV is aimed at providing the basic tools needed to solve computer vision problems. In some cases, high-level functionalities in the library will be sufficient to
solve the more complex problems in computer vision. Even when this is not the case, the basic components in the library are complete enoufh to enable creation of a
complete solution of your own to almost any computer vision problem.
